# Winter Solstice Pattern in the Draíocht Calendar (2025-2044)

## Astronomical Foundation

This analysis is based on the precise moon phase data from timeanddate.com as provided in the moonphases.csv file. The calendar structure follows these principles:

1. The month containing the vernal (spring) equinox is named "Idir-Ré"
2. All other months are numbered sequentially from the month following Idir-Ré
3. Each month begins precisely on the astronomical new moon
4. A 13-month year occurs when 13 complete lunar cycles fit between consecutive spring equinoxes

## The 19-Year Pattern

Based on accurate astronomical data, here's the winter solstice pattern over the 19-year Metonic cycle:

| Year | Gregorian Date | Draíocht Date | Year Type |
|------|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| 2025 | December 21 | Month 10, Day 3   | 13-month year |
| 2026 | December 21 | Month 9, Day 14   | 12-month year |
| 2027 | December 21 | Month 9, Day 25   | 12-month year |
| 2028 | December 21 | Month 10, Day 7   | 13-month year |
| 2029 | December 21 | Month 9, Day 17   | 12-month year |
| 2030 | December 21 | Month 9, Day 27   | 12-month year |
| 2031 | December 21 | Month 10, Day 8   | 13-month year |
| 2032 | December 21 | Month 9, Day 20   | 12-month year |
| 2033 | December 21 | Month 10, Day 1   | 13-month year |
| 2034 | December 21 | Month 9, Day 12   | 12-month year |
| 2035 | December 22 | Month 9, Day 23   | 12-month year |
| 2036 | December 21 | Month 10, Day 5   | 13-month year |
| 2037 | December 21 | Month 9, Day 16   | 12-month year |
| 2038 | December 21 | Month 9, Day 26   | 12-month year |
| 2039 | December 22 | Month 10, Day 7   | 13-month year |
| 2040 | December 21 | Month 9, Day 18   | 12-month year |
| 2041 | December 21 | Month 9, Day 29   | 12-month year |
| 2042 | December 21 | Month 10, Day 10  | 13-month year |
| 2043 | December 22 | Month 9, Day 21   | 12-month year |
| 2044 | December 21 | Month 10, Day 3   | 12-month year |

The 13-month years in this pattern are: 2025, 2028, 2031, 2033, 2036, 2039, and 2042.

## Key Observations

1. **Two-Month Pattern**: The winter solstice alternates between Month 9 (12 years) and Month 10 (8 years) throughout the 19-year cycle.

2. **Month 10 Correlation**: The winter solstice appears in Month 10 primarily during 13-month years (6 out of 8 occurrences), with only two appearances in 12-month years (2044 being one of them).

3. **Month 9 Late Position**: When falling in Month 9, the solstice typically occurs in the latter half of the month (days 12-29), creating a pattern of late-month positioning.

4. **Metonic Cycle Verification**: Looking at the pattern from 2025 to 2044, we can see it begins to repeat after 19 years, with the solstice occurring on Day 3 of Month 10 in both 2025 and 2044.

5. **Month Connection**: There appears to be a consistent pattern where Month 9 is associated with 12-month years and Month 10 is associated with 13-month years (with few exceptions).

This pattern demonstrates a consistent two-month oscillation for the winter solstice, with a clear connection to the 13-month/12-month year structure. The regularity of this pattern throughout the Metonic cycle provides a predictable framework for winter solstice traditions and observations in the Draíocht Calendar system.
