# Draíocht Calendar (2025-2026)

## Calendar Structure

This calendar follows a lunar-seasonal approach where:
- Each month begins precisely on the astronomical new moon
- The month containing the vernal (spring) equinox is named "Idir-Ré"
- All other months follow the hybrid deity/seasonal naming system
- The cycle continues until we reach the next occurrence of Idir-Ré

Note: All dates and times are sourced from timeanddate.com for New York (Eastern Time) as the definitive reference source for this calendar.

## Notes on the Calendar

1. **Idir-Ré (Equinox Month)**:
   - This is whichever lunar month contains the vernal equinox
   - It serves as both the final month of one year and the first month of the next
   - The vernal equinox (March 20) marks the transition point within this month
   - The month is divided into two distinct phases:
      * **Dorcha-Idir-Ré** (Dark Between-Time): The portion before the vernal equinox, when nights are still longer than days
      * **Geal-Idir-Ré** (Bright Between-Time): The portion after the vernal equinox, when days become longer than nights

2. **13-Month Cycle**:
   - The 2025-2026 cycle contains 13 complete lunar months
   - This is a natural occurrence that happens approximately every 2-3 years when 13 complete lunar cycles fit between consecutive lunar months containing the spring equinox
   - The appearance of Danu, named for the primordial mother goddess, is significant as this month only manifests during these special 13-month years

3. **Seasonal Markers**:
   - Vernal Equinox: March 20, 2025 (During first Idir-Ré)
   - Summer Solstice: June 20, 2025 (During Grian-Ard)
   - Autumnal Equinox: September 23, 2025 (During Maponos)
   - Winter Solstice: December 21, 2025 (During Sucellos)
   - Next Vernal Equinox: March 20, 2026 (During second Idir-Ré)

4. **Lunar Cycle Characteristics**:
   - Average lunar month length: 29.53 days
   - Actual month lengths vary between 29-30 days
   - The moon's elliptical orbit creates natural variations in month length
   - All times given for New Moon are in Eastern Time (New York)
