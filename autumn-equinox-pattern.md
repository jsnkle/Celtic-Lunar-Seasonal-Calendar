# Autumn Equinox Pattern in the Draíocht Calendar (2025-2044)

## Astronomical Foundation

This analysis is based on the precise moon phase data from timeanddate.com as provided in the moonphases.csv file. The calendar structure follows these principles:

1. The month containing the vernal (spring) equinox is named "Idir-Ré"
2. All other months are numbered sequentially from the month following Idir-Ré
3. Each month begins precisely on the astronomical new moon
4. A 13-month year occurs when 13 complete lunar cycles fit between consecutive spring equinoxes

## The 19-Year Pattern

Based on accurate astronomical data, here's the autumn equinox pattern over the 19-year Metonic cycle:

| Year | Gregorian Date | Draíocht Date | Year Type |
|------|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| 2025 | September 22 | Month 7, Day 2   | 13-month year |
| 2026 | September 22 | Month 6, Day 13  | 12-month year |
| 2027 | September 23 | Month 6, Day 23  | 12-month year |
| 2028 | September 22 | Month 7, Day 5   | 13-month year |
| 2029 | September 22 | Month 6, Day 15  | 12-month year |
| 2030 | September 22 | Month 6, Day 26  | 12-month year |
| 2031 | September 23 | Month 7, Day 7   | 13-month year |
| 2032 | September 22 | Month 6, Day 19  | 12-month year |
| 2033 | September 22 | Month 6, Day 30  | 13-month year |
| 2034 | September 23 | Month 6, Day 11  | 12-month year |
| 2035 | September 22 | Month 6, Day 22  | 12-month year |
| 2036 | September 22 | Month 7, Day 4   | 13-month year |
| 2037 | September 23 | Month 6, Day 14  | 12-month year |
| 2038 | September 22 | Month 6, Day 24  | 12-month year |
| 2039 | September 23 | Month 7, Day 5   | 13-month year |
| 2040 | September 22 | Month 6, Day 17  | 12-month year |
| 2041 | September 22 | Month 6, Day 28  | 12-month year |
| 2042 | September 23 | Month 7, Day 9   | 13-month year |
| 2043 | September 22 | Month 6, Day 20  | 12-month year |
| 2044 | September 22 | Month 7, Day 2   | 12-month year |

The 13-month years in this pattern are: 2025, 2028, 2031, 2033, 2036, 2039, and 2042.

## Key Observations

1. **Two-Month Pattern**: The autumn equinox alternates between Month 6 (13 years) and Month 7 (7 years) throughout the 19-year cycle.

2. **Month 7 Correlation**: The autumn equinox appears in Month 7 primarily during 13-month years (6 out of 7 occurrences), with only one appearance in a 12-month year (2044).

3. **Month 6 Late Position**: When falling in Month 6, the equinox often occurs in the latter half of the month (days 15-30), creating a pattern of late-month positioning.

4. **Metonic Cycle Verification**: Looking at the pattern from 2025 to 2044, we can see it begins to repeat after 19 years, with the equinox occurring on Day 2 of Month 7 in both 2025 and 2044.

This pattern demonstrates a consistent two-month oscillation for the autumn equinox, with a clear tendency toward Month 6. The connection between 13-month years and Month 7 occurrences suggests a structural relationship in the calendar that maintains this regular pattern throughout the Metonic cycle.
