# Autumn Equinox Pattern in the Celtic Lunar-Seasonal Calendar (2025-2044)

## Spiritual Interpretations

Each alignment of the autumn equinox with a particular month creates unique energetic conditions:

### Autumn Equinox in Mórrígan

*Years: 2025, 2028, 2032, 2036, 2039, 2043*

When the perfect balance of light and dark occurs in the month of the great queen of sovereignty and transformation, we experience a profound opportunity for deep personal change. The Mórrígan's energy of death and rebirth aligns with the cosmic balance point, creating ideal conditions for releasing what no longer serves and claiming personal power.

**Ritual focus:** Transformation, shadow work, release of outdated identities, reclaiming sovereignty

### Autumn Equinox in Cothrom

*Years: 2026, 2027, 2029, 2030, 2033, 2037, 2040, 2044*

Balance upon balance! The equilibrium energy of Cothrom (meaning "balance" in Irish) aligns with the equinox's perfect day-night balance. This double harmony creates exceptional conditions for bringing all aspects of life into alignment, resolving polarities, and finding the middle path.

**Ritual focus:** Harmonizing opposites, justice, ethical decisions, finding the middle way

### Autumn Equinox in Danu

*Years: 2031, 2034, 2035, 2038, 2041*

The primordial wisdom of the mother goddess Danu meets the balanced threshold of seasons. This alignment creates a powerful connection to ancestral wisdom, lineage healing, and accessing the deep wellsprings of ancient knowing. The equinox balance point opens a clear channel to Danu's timeless perspective.

**Ritual focus:** Ancestral connection, accessing deep wisdom, connecting to lineage, honoring the elder aspects

### Autumn Equinox in Cernunnos

*Year: 2042*

A rare alignment where the wild nature of the horned god meets the balanced threshold between light and dark. This unique combination creates an extraordinary opportunity to harmonize our civilized and wild natures, to find balance between the human and more-than-human worlds, and to integrate opposing forces within the psyche.

**Ritual focus:** Wild nature connection, animal communication, integrating instinct and intellect

## Working with the Pattern

These alignments offer opportunities for intentional ritual work that honors the unique qualities of each combination. By tracking the pattern, practitioners can prepare special observances for years when particularly significant alignments occur.

The prevalence of the autumn equinox in Cothrom throughout the cycle emphasizes the importance of balance as we transition to the darker half of the year, while its appearances in Mórrígan, Danu, and rarely Cernunnos offer special opportunities for transformation, ancestral wisdom, and wild nature connection respectively.
