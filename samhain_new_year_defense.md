# On the Question of Samhain as the Celtic New Year

A common critique of any calendar inspired by Celtic tradition that does **not** begin the year at **Samhain** is that it fails to honor what many claim was the ancient Celtic New Year. This belief has become especially widespread in neopagan and revivalist literature, but it is important to examine whether this claim is truly supported by historical, astronomical, or mythological evidence.

## What the Evidence Actually Shows

Samhain was undoubtedly a significant seasonal festival in early Irish tradition. It marked the **entry into the dark half of the year**, a time of **liminality**, **ancestor veneration**, and **ritual thresholds**. Early medieval Irish texts, such as those found in the Mythological Cycle, reference gatherings, feasting, and spiritual phenomena tied to Samhain. However, **none of these sources explicitly define it as the beginning of the year**.

Much of the idea that *“Samhain was the Celtic New Year”* comes from **19th and 20th-century interpretations**—particularly from romantic scholars like **Sir James Frazer**, who connected harvest festivals to “death of the year” themes found in other world mythologies. While evocative, these are largely **theoretical frameworks**, not declarations found in indigenous texts or supported by early calendars.

## Solar and Astronomical Context

Unlike the solstices and equinoxes, **Samhain is not marked by any celestial event**. There are **no known megalithic sites** aligned with the sun or moon at Samhain's approximate date (November 1). In contrast:

- **Newgrange** is aligned to the **Winter Solstice sunrise**
- Several stone circles are aligned with **equinoxes and lunar events**

These architectural alignments suggest that **ancient timekeeping was based on celestial transitions**—not fixed agricultural midpoints. While Samhain likely held great **symbolic and communal significance**, it was not anchored to a verifiable solar or lunar moment.

## Why the Calendar Begins with the Vernal Equinox

This calendar begins the year at the **vernal equinox**—the moment when day and night are equal, and the light begins to overtake the dark in the Northern Hemisphere. This decision is rooted in several principles:

- It reflects a **cosmological balance** and **natural turning point** in the solar cycle.
- It marks the **emergence from the dark half**, a metaphorical rebirth aligned with many spiritual traditions.
- It affirms the Druidic concept of **thresholds**—the equinox is a gateway, not a midpoint.

Moreover, the calendar’s structure—beginning each **month with the new moon**—ensures that **nights precede days**, aligning with Julius Caesar’s remark that the Celts "counted time by nights."

## Conclusion

Samhain remains a sacred threshold in this calendar, recognized as the **portal into descent**, a time of remembrance, mystery, and ancestral communion. But to build a system that honors **both spiritual symbolism and observable natural cycles**, the **vernal equinox** serves as the more fitting and **cosmically anchored** beginning.
