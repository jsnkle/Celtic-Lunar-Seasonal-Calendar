# Draíocht Calendar: Month Naming Concept

## Philosophical Framework: The Cosmic Journey

This naming scheme tells the story of cosmic balance, movement to extremes, and return to center, using Old Irish terms that would align with what we understand of Druidic philosophy, while remaining hemisphere-neutral by focusing on astronomical positions rather than seasonal effects.

## The Twelve Standard Months

### 1. **Idir-Ré** (Between-Time)
- Contains the vernal equinox - the first balance point
- Threshold month marking the beginning/end of the cycle
- Represents the liminal state between cycles

### 2. **Éirí** (Rising/Ascension)
- First full month after the vernal equinox
- Represents the sun's path beginning to climb higher in the northern sky
- The beginning of movement away from equilibrium

### 3. **Neartú** (Strengthening/Intensifying)
- Second month after vernal equinox
- The sun's pathway continues to shift northward
- Movement toward the first extreme intensifies

### 4. **Grian Thuaidh** (Sun North)
- Contains the northern solstice (summer in north, winter in south)
- Maximum northern position of the sun
- The first extreme point in the cosmic journey

### 5. **Iompú** (Turning/Transformation)
- First month after the northern solstice
- First subtle shift back toward center
- Beginning of sun's southern movement

### 6. **Cothromú** (Balancing/Equalizing)
- Second month after northern solstice
- More pronounced movement toward balance
- Preparation for the coming equilibrium

### 7. **Réiteach** (Reconciliation/Resolution)
- Contains the autumnal equinox - the second balance point
- Perfect equilibrium between northern and southern influences
- The midpoint of the cosmic journey

### 8. **Ísliú** (Lowering/Descending)
- First month after the autumnal equinox
- Beginning of the sun's more pronounced southern path
- Starting the movement toward the second extreme

### 9. **Doimhniú** (Deepening)
- Second month after autumnal equinox
- Continued movement southward
- Approaching the second extreme point

### 10. **Grian Theas** (Sun South)
- Contains the southern solstice (winter in north, summer in south)
- Maximum southern position of the sun
- The second extreme point in the cosmic journey

### 11. **Filleadh** (Returning)
- First month after the southern solstice
- Beginning of the return journey
- First movement back toward equilibrium

### 12. **Aisling** (Vision/Dream)
- Final month before completing the cycle
- Anticipation of renewal and the coming threshold
- Preparation for the return to balance

### Special 13th Month: **Ré Anann** (Era of Anu)
- Appears only in long years with 13 complete lunar cycles
- Named for the historically attested mother goddess
- Represents the primordial matrix from which all cycles emerge

## Philosophical Significance

This naming scheme weaves together several elements that would have been important in Druidic philosophy:

1. **Observational Astronomy**: Each name relates to the observable position of the sun

2. **Cyclical Time**: The names create a coherent narrative of the complete annual cycle

3. **Balance and Extremes**: The scheme emphasizes the journey from center to edge and back again

4. **Threshold Consciousness**: Special attention to transitional moments (equinoxes and solstices)

5. **Hemisphere Neutrality**: Focus on astronomical positions rather than seasonal effects

The journey from balance (Idir-Ré) to northern extreme (Grian Thuaidh) to balance again (Réiteach) to southern extreme (Grian Theas) and back to balance creates a complete cosmic story that would have resonated with Druidic understanding of existence as cyclical and balanced, while remaining relevant to observers in both hemispheres.
