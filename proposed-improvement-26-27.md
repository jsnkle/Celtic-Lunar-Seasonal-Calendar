# Draíocht Calendar (2026-2027)

## Calendar Structure

This calendar follows a lunar-seasonal approach where:
- Each month begins precisely on the astronomical new moon
- The month containing the vernal (spring) equinox is named "Idir-Ré"
- All other months follow the astronomical/positional naming system
- The cycle continues until we reach the next occurrence of Idir-Ré

Note: All dates and times are sourced from the moon-phases.csv data for New York (Eastern Time) as the definitive reference source for this calendar.

## Notes on the Calendar

1. **Idir-Ré (Equinox Month)**:
   - This is whichever lunar month contains the vernal equinox
   - It serves as both the final month of one year and the first month of the next
   - The vernal equinox (March 20) marks the transition point within this month
   - The month is divided into two distinct phases:
      * **Idir-Ré Críoch** (ID-eer RAY kree-ukh) - Ending Between-Time: The portion before the vernal equinox, representing the completion of the previous cycle
      * **Idir-Ré Tús** (ID-eer RAY toose) - Beginning Between-Time: The portion after the vernal equinox, representing the inception of the new cycle

2. **12-Month Cycle**:
   - The 2026-2027 cycle contains 12 complete lunar months
   - This contrasts with the 2025-2026 cycle which had 13 months, demonstrating the natural variability in the relationship between lunar cycles and the solar year
   - In this standard 12-month year, Ré Anann does not appear, as this special month only manifests during 13-month years

3. **Seasonal Markers**:
   - Vernal Equinox: March 20, 2026 (During first Idir-Ré)
   - Northern Solstice: June 20, 2026 (During Grian Thuaidh)
   - Autumnal Equinox: September 22, 2026 (During Réiteach)
   - Southern Solstice: December 21, 2026 (During Grian Theas)
   - Next Vernal Equinox: March 20, 2027 (During second Idir-Ré)

4. **Lunar Cycle Characteristics**:
   - Average lunar month length: 29.53 days
   - Actual month lengths vary between 29-31 days
   - The moon's elliptical orbit creates natural variations in month length
   - All times given for New Moon are in Eastern Time (New York)

## Month Names and Meanings

This naming system tells the story of cosmic balance, movement to extremes, and return to center, using Irish Gaelic terms that align with Druidic philosophy while remaining hemisphere-neutral by focusing on astronomical positions rather than seasonal effects.

| Month | Name              | Meaning                                                                              |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 4     | **Grian Thuaidh** | Sun North (contains the northern solstice - the first extreme point)                 |
| 5     | **Iompú**         | Turning/Transformation (first month after the northern solstice)                     |

| 7     | **Réiteach**      | Reconciliation/Resolution (contains the autumnal equinox - the second balance point) |
| 8     | **Ísliú**         | Lowering/Descending (first month after the autumnal equinox)                         |

| 10    | **Grian Theas**   | Sun South (contains the southern solstice - the second extreme point)                |
| 11    | **Filleadh**      | Returning (first month after the southern solstice)                                  |
| 12    | **Aisling**       | Vision/Dream (final month before completing the cycle)                               |
| 13    | **Ré Anann**      | Era of Anu (special 13th month appearing only in longer years)                       |

## Philosophical Approach

This calendar system embodies several key philosophical principles:

1. **Natural Astronomical Observation Over Mathematical Convenience**: Prioritizes actual astronomical events rather than imposing artificial mathematical patterns

2. **Threshold Concept as Central Philosophy**: Uses Idir-Ré as a liminal space divided by the vernal equinox, embodying the Druidic appreciation for "between times"

3. **Balance of Solar and Lunar Cycles**: Neither solar nor lunar cycle is subordinated to the other, creating a natural harmony without artificial adjustments

4. **Embrace of Natural 13-Month Cycles**: Acknowledges when 13 full lunar cycles occur naturally between consecutive equinox-containing months

5. **Hemisphere Neutrality**: Focuses on astronomical positions rather than seasonal effects, making the calendar relevant worldwide

6. **Cosmic Journey Narrative**: Tells the story of movement from balance to extremes and back again, reflecting the natural cycles that govern all life
