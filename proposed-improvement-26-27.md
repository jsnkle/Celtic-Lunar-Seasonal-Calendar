# Proposed Improvement to Draíocht Calendar (2026-2027)

## Calendar Structure

This calendar follows a lunar-seasonal approach where:
- Each month begins precisely on the astronomical new moon
- The month containing the vernal (spring) equinox is named "Idir-Ré"
- All other months are numbered sequentially from the month following Idir-Ré
- The cycle continues until we reach the next occurrence of Idir-Ré

Note: All dates and times are sourced from the moon-phases.csv data for New York (Eastern Time) as the definitive reference source for this calendar.

## Lunar Months and Gregorian Correspondence (2026-2027)

| **Month 10**      | January 7, 2027 | February 5, 2027 | 30 days | |
| **Month 11**      | February 6, 2027 | March 7, 2027 | 30 days | |

## Notes on the Calendar

1. **Idir-Ré (Equinox Month)**:
    - This is whichever lunar month contains the vernal equinox
    - It serves as both the final month of one year and the first month of the next
    - The vernal equinox (March 20) marks the transition point within this month
    - The month is divided into two distinct phases:
        * **Dorcha-Idir-Ré** (Dark Between-Time): The portion before the vernal equinox, when nights are still longer than days
        * **Geal-Idir-Ré** (Bright Between-Time): The portion after the vernal equinox, when days become longer than nights

2. **12-Month Cycle**:
    - The 2026-2027 cycle contains 12 complete lunar months
    - This contrasts with the 2025-2026 cycle which had 13 months, demonstrating the natural variability in the relationship between lunar cycles and the solar year

3. **Seasonal Markers**:
    - Vernal Equinox: March 20, 2026 (During first Idir-Ré)
    - Summer Solstice: June 20, 2026 (During Month 3)
    - Autumnal Equinox: September 22, 2026 (During Month 6)
    - Winter Solstice: December 21, 2026 (During Month 9)
    - Next Vernal Equinox: March 20, 2027 (During second Idir-Ré)

4. **Lunar Cycle Characteristics**:
    - Average lunar month length: 29.53 days
    - Actual month lengths vary between 29-31 days
    - The moon's elliptical orbit creates natural variations in month length
    - All times given for New Moon are in Eastern Time (New York)

## Meaning of "Idir-Ré"

"Idir-Ré" combines Irish Gaelic elements:
- "Idir" means "between" or "among"
- "Ré" can refer to "time," "period," or "moon"

Together, the name evokes the concept of a threshold or transitional time, marking the space between years as the earth moves from winter into spring. This month uniquely contains the moment of transition (vernal equinox) that divides one year from the next.
