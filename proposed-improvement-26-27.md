# Draíocht Calendar (2026-2027)

## Calendar Structure

This calendar follows a lunar-seasonal approach where:
- Each month begins precisely on the astronomical new moon
- The month containing the vernal (spring) equinox is named "Idir-Ré"
- All other months follow the hybrid deity/seasonal naming system
- The cycle continues until we reach the next occurrence of Idir-Ré

Note: All dates and times are sourced from the moon-phases.csv data for New York (Eastern Time) as the definitive reference source for this calendar.

## Notes on the Calendar

1. **Idir-Ré (Equinox Month)**:
   - This is whichever lunar month contains the vernal equinox
   - It serves as both the final month of one year and the first month of the next
   - The vernal equinox (March 20) marks the transition point within this month
   - The month is divided into two distinct phases:
      * **Dorcha-Idir-Ré** (Dark Between-Time): The portion before the vernal equinox, when nights are still longer than days
      * **Geal-Idir-Ré** (Bright Between-Time): The portion after the vernal equinox, when days become longer than nights

2. **12-Month Cycle**:
   - The 2026-2027 cycle contains 12 complete lunar months
   - This contrasts with the 2025-2026 cycle which had 13 months, demonstrating the natural variability in the relationship between lunar cycles and the solar year
   - In this standard 12-month year, Danu does not appear, as this special month only manifests during 13-month years

3. **Seasonal Markers**:
   - Vernal Equinox: March 20, 2026 (During first Idir-Ré)
   - Summer Solstice: June 20, 2026 (During Grian-Ard)
   - Autumnal Equinox: September 22, 2026 (During Meán-Fómhair)
   - Winter Solstice: December 21, 2026 (During Grianstad)
   - Next Vernal Equinox: March 20, 2027 (During second Idir-Ré)

4. **Lunar Cycle Characteristics**:
   - Average lunar month length: 29.53 days
   - Actual month lengths vary between 29-31 days
   - The moon's elliptical orbit creates natural variations in month length
   - All times given for New Moon are in Eastern Time (New York)

## Philosophical Approach

This calendar system embodies several key philosophical principles:

1. **Harmony Between Natural and Divine**: Recognizes both the physical cycles of nature and the spiritual powers that govern them

2. **Balance of Energies**: Honors both masculine and feminine divine powers with emphasis on the feminine divine (reflecting important aspects of Celtic spirituality)

3. **Seasonal Attunement**: Keeps practitioners connected to the actual astronomical and agricultural rhythms

4. **Historical Authenticity**: Uses deity names with archaeological evidence from the pre-Roman Celtic period

5. **Practical Spirituality**: Combines pragmatic seasonal markers with sacred connections to divine powers
