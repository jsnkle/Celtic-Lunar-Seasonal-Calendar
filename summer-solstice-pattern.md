# Summer Solstice Pattern in the Draíocht Calendar (2025-2044)

## Astronomical Foundation

This analysis is based on the precise moon phase data from timeanddate.com as provided in the moonphases.csv file. The calendar structure follows these principles:

1. The month containing the vernal (spring) equinox is named "Idir-Ré"
2. All other months are numbered sequentially from the month following Idir-Ré
3. Each month begins precisely on the astronomical new moon
4. A 13-month year occurs when 13 complete lunar cycles fit between consecutive spring equinoxes

## The 19-Year Pattern

Based on accurate astronomical data, here's the summer solstice pattern over the 19-year Metonic cycle:

| Year | Gregorian Date | Draíocht Date | Year Type |
|------|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| 2025 | June 20 | Month 3, Day 27  | 13-month year |
| 2026 | June 20 | Month 3, Day 8   | 12-month year |
| 2027 | June 21 | Month 3, Day 18  | 12-month year |
| 2028 | June 20 | Month 3, Day 29  | 13-month year |
| 2029 | June 21 | Month 3, Day 11  | 12-month year |
| 2030 | June 21 | Month 3, Day 21  | 12-month year |
| 2031 | June 21 | Month 4, Day 3   | 13-month year |
| 2032 | June 20 | Month 3, Day 15  | 12-month year |
| 2033 | June 21 | Month 3, Day 25  | 13-month year |
| 2034 | June 21 | Month 3, Day 6   | 12-month year |
| 2035 | June 21 | Month 3, Day 17  | 12-month year |
| 2036 | June 20 | Month 3, Day 28  | 13-month year |
| 2037 | June 21 | Month 3, Day 9   | 12-month year |
| 2038 | June 21 | Month 3, Day 20  | 12-month year |
| 2039 | June 21 | Month 4, Day 1   | 13-month year |
| 2040 | June 20 | Month 3, Day 13  | 12-month year |
| 2041 | June 21 | Month 3, Day 24  | 12-month year |
| 2042 | June 21 | Month 4, Day 5   | 13-month year |
| 2043 | June 21 | Month 3, Day 15  | 12-month year |
| 2044 | June 20 | Month 3, Day 27  | 12-month year |

The 13-month years in this pattern are: 2025, 2028, 2031, 2033, 2036, 2039, and 2042.

## Key Observations

1. **Almost Single Month Predominance**: The summer solstice occurs predominantly in Month 3 (17 out of 20 years), with only occasional appearances in Month 4 (3 out of 20 years).

2. **Month 4 Appearances**: The summer solstice appears in Month 4 only during 13-month years (2031, 2039, and 2042).

3. **Cyclical Pattern**: The summer solstice returns to nearly the same position after 19 years (Month 3, Day 27 in both 2025 and 2044), demonstrating the Metonic cycle principle.

4. **Day Range**: The summer solstice occurs between Day 3 and Day 29 in Month 3, offering a wide range of positions within the month.

This pattern shows a stronger consistency than initially expected, with the summer solstice occurring predominantly in Month 3 throughout the 19-year cycle. This creates a relatively stable anchor point for summer solstice traditions and observations in the Draíocht Calendar system.
